#Possible Plot Twist Plots

[Classes/Characters Enemies list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kaomcQkceVAOTYUQdjRibMUL1o5Nvny7AD1YXOAce5M/edit#gid=0)

##General Premise
Player grows foods to fend off invaders. Front-line foods keep back-line foods safe from invaders. Foods should evolve and improve/gain abilities over the course of the game.

### Retired Scientist
(Most viable as of 2/8)
Used to be a weapons manufacturer/powerful Wizard. After retirement, you took the path of peace and decided to took up farming. A nearby siege has left the army famished. The soldiers are hungry and decide to turn to your farm for sustenance. You must quell the invaders by feeding (or killing) them. 
Once the soldiers are fed, they retreat back to camp. They leave behind battlements and trinkets for compensation.



### Monsanto/GMO
Player is a large farm/agriculture company (i.e. Monsanto). You grow plants that defend your factory/warehouse/etc. from competing companies.
This is done by raising sentient food stuffs to protect your precious experiments. In the beginning, you're merely cross-breeding and using 'traditional' techniques to improve your crops.
As you reach the pinnacle of naturally occurring plants and animals, you begin to dabble in Genetically Modified Organisms. This draws more scrutiny from the world, and attacks on your warehouse increase.

### Feed the World
Player is a benevolent authoritarian ruler who is the sole distributor of food stuffs in Plotlandia. As peasants invade the fields of PlotLandia, you must keep them full by sending out small sentient food to invaders.
They eat the food and become pacified and retreat. You're the only one alive who can avoid the temptation of eating the next days seeds, so you must guard them carefully, out of reach of the hungry peasants.
Possible issue: Billionaire "Mr. Smarty Pants" ideology is kinda dead right now. Not very believable

### Feed your pets
Similar to feed the world, but instead of peasants, you're feeding your pets their appropriate foodstuffs. 
Possible issue: leading people to believe certain pets can safely eat many different kinds of foods (ex: a dog eating chocolate). Could be very un-educational


## Mechanics
Similar map style to Plants vs. Zombies, but mechanically and flavor-fully very different.

5 "Lanes"

Ground can offer advantages / disadvantages

Columns can offer advantages / disadvantages

Comboing veggies to create more powerful things.

#### Advancement over time
Short term resource gain: Killing/pacifying invaders, resources over time, and/or manual clicking (similar to P v Z)

Mid term advantages (Session length): Growing new plants to defend your back-row developments. Also possible: Maintaining current crops/healing. Healing doesn't match up that well with food, though

Long term Plans (Multi-Session/Campaign): Improve food stuffs through traditional breeding methods => GMOs. 

## Long term Vision
Create a game that is easy to pick and play, interesting and fun for casual players, with lots of replayability. (All of these easier said than done.)
Publish game through some distribution service on mobile. Support multiple platforms (iOs, Android, etc.).
Multi-player capabilities through sending food stuffs to other player's yards to aid the oncoming forces. Each in-game "day" a player will have forces that overcome the onslaught and successfully progress off the map (hopefully). These excessive forces will accumulate over the day, and at the end of the day the player will either send them to aid or harm one of their friend's camps.


### Money Bucks 
'Free-mium' model for possible monetization. Users can download/install the App for free, but certain features and/or ads generate revenue.
Generate interest and popularity through a completely free to play model. No 'competitive' advantage should be able to be gained from premium features.
